# US_typology_of_voters
Using the American National Election Survey data from 2024, this project created a typology of American voters. The analyses revealed 4 clusters of voters: (1) working class Christian tradtionalists; (2) progressive educated urbanites; (3) white conservative investor men; (4) diverse women with immigrant ties.
